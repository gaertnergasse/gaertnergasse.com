Been of a relatively amorphous form before, the ground works were transformed to a more restrained practice combined with hanging sculptures that originated during her stay in South Korea. Her artistic method borrows language and aesthetics that welcome the viewer into a set-dimension that seeks to suspend time and questions ideologies and habits. </p><p> In “I slept like a Dog, covered in Moss”, Céline seeks to deconstruct and investigate the controlled sense of sight, as opposed to cultural contemplations upon it. Seeing does not exclusively mean seeing, as each gaze needs an abstraction to it. This implies a consideration or even more, reconsideration upon the mere thought of sight, when the gaze and the eye interlace with a longing for touch. The evaluation of vision and touch, as well as distance and proximity, lay in a questioning of the determination of site according to one’s presence in the specific space. Orchestrated by the artist, these agents hold the objects as well as spectators. Ground sculptures filled up with a conglomerate of water, ink and luminophor, seemingly of dense materiality, iridescent in their visual representation change visibility through a play of sunlight, positioning and reflection. As a playful chiasmus almost – things being touched by gaze and objects looking at the beholder – these are guiding the spectator via an invisible path along the objects that mark the floor. “I slept like a Dog, covered in Moss” meets the visitors with a pictorial language that challenges an imposed way of seeing, as well as everyday filters connected to a juxtaposition and hierarchy of forms, material and gaze. </p><p> Céline’s aim to consider a democracy of form in her artistic work is a claim to perform a gesture and serves as an elliptic introduction to an exhibition that collects aspects of the uncertain relationship of the viewer and the object. With a focus on the film “Witch Island” the exhibition circles back and forth between the limitation of movements by the audience and the pivot of the constellation of the relationship between formal and material aesthetics in all presented media. Introducing three chapters as a narrative, the fourth may be found as an environment that resonates on the conducted experience by the artist. </p><p>- Marie Oucherif</p></div><div class="frame"><div class="annotate"><img src="/gaertnergasse.com/2018/i-slept-like-a-dog-covered-in-moss/img/4.jpg"><p>Céline Struger, I slept like a dog covered in moss, 2018, exhibition view, Gärtnergasse, Vienna</p></div><div class="annotate"><img src="/gaertnergasse.com/2018/i-slept-like-a-dog-covered-in-moss/img/5.jpg"><p>Céline Struger, I slept like a dog covered in moss, 2018, exhibition view, Gärtnergasse, Vienna</p></div><div class="annotate"><img src="/gaertnergasse.com/2018/i-slept-like-a-dog-covered-in-moss/img/6.jpg"><p>Céline Struger, Black Flower 2, 2018</p><p>Papermaché, bitumen</p></div><div class="annotate"><img src="/gaertnergasse.com/2018/i-slept-like-a-dog-covered-in-moss/img/7.jpg"><p>Céline Struger, Bong Eyed Borealis II, 2018</p><p>Steel, water, drawing ink</p></div><img src="/gaertnergasse.com/2018/i-slept-like-a-dog-covered-in-moss/img/8.jpg"><div class="annotate"><img src="/gaertnergasse.com/2018/i-slept-like-a-dog-covered-in-moss/img/9.jpg"><p>Céline Struger, Bong Eyed Borealis II, 2018</p></div><div class="annotate"><img src="/gaertnergasse.com/2018/i-slept-like-a-dog-covered-in-moss/img/10.jpg"><p>Céline Struger, Black Flower 3, 2018</p><p>Papermaché, bitumen</p></div><img src="/gaertnergasse.com/2018/i-slept-like-a-dog-covered-in-moss/img/11.jpg"><img src="/gaertnergasse.com/2018/i-slept-like-a-dog-covered-in-moss/img/12.jpg"><div class="annotate"><img src="/gaertnergasse.com/2018/i-slept-like-a-dog-covered-in-moss/img/13.jpg"><p>Céline Struger, Witch Island, 2018</p></div><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/295061220" width="1200" height="600" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><div class="frame"><h4>Witch Island</h4><p></p><p> We took a room at witch island <br> In the house of a family with <br> Barbecue, onions drying on the ground <br> And cats and dogs spotted with flees </p><p> In the first night <br> My friend dreamed that <br> He and his mother witnessed <br> A car accident </p><p> The impact tore <br> The drivers head off <br> In two parts </p><p> Echoing noise <br> Splintering glass <br> And my friends mother turned to him <br> In the aftermath of silence <br> And said <br> Maybe he deserved it </p><p> In the second night <br> I woke up around 3 AM <br> And walked towards the beach <br> Dogs barking at me <br> Every couple of metres </p><p> I saw a cat <br> In the middle of the road <br> Sitting upright <br> It didn’t move <br> When I approached it <br> I saw that <br> its head was trapped <br> In a tin can </p><p> I gripped it at the neck <br> It screamed excruciating <br> When I tried to loosen the can </p><p> On the 3rd evening <br> The mist came <br> It rolled up from the sea <br> Covering it fleetly </p><p> My friend and I walked next to each other at first <br> The suitcases sunk into the carpet <br> Sticking to it, as to roadkill </p><p> But then <br> My contact lens got flushed away <br> With trembling fingers <br> I retraced it’s <br> Every possible position <br> By palpation <br> But No </p><p> In the end <br> I spent what felt fifteen minutes <br> Walking away from the spoondrift <br> Holding one squinting eyeball down <br> towards <br> the lunar landscape under my feet <br> And the other one <br> In front of my chest <br> scanning the white-out <br> for something like <br> a horizon </p><p>- Celine Struger</p></div><footer><p class="title"><a href="/gaertnergasse.com/"> &lt;&lt; <span class="space">Gärtnergasse</span></a></p></footer></body></html>
