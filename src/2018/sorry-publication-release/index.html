        right now i'm sitting at gärtnergasse1.
        i feel very weird honestly
        even though it finally started to rain after such a damp and hot day.
        i knew that it would have to become dark for me
        to finally be able to think clear again.
        so i was standing outside ok the street
        just now my palms shaping
        a two little bathtubs for the drops to fall into.
        i don't know if i should pray or cry.
        hysteria has not reached me yet.
        the publications are somewhere in a car from bratislava to vienna.
        the driver is not picking up the phone.
        our table is empty and our fridge is full.
        i can only offer you to wait here with me in the rain.
        <br>
        i am very sorry
